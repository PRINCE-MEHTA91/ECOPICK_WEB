## About The Project

EcoPick is an innovative web application designed to promote recycling and environmental sustainability. Using a client-side AI model built with Teachable Machine, it allows users to upload images of waste materials and instantly receive an identification of the material. The platform also features user dashboards to track recycling history and calculate the potential earnings from the recycled items.

This project aims to make recycling more accessible and informative for everyone, encouraging more people to participate in creating a cleaner planet.
